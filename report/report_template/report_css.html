        <h2>Numbers</h2>
            <p>no_hit: No hit was found for the read.<br>
            Ambigious: Read had two or more equally well hits.<br>
            Unclassified: Read has no hit on genus/species level, but does have a hit on a higher level (e.g. family).<br>
            Missing_genus: Read has a hit with a specified species, but a genus name is missing (often with virusses).<br>
            Not_distributed [Bracken specific]: Read could not be distributed down (due to absence of lower tax level or given threshold).<br>
            Rounding_error [Bracken specific]: Due to re-estimation based on Bayes' theorem, the number of assigned reads are fractions.
                                               In practice, however, these fractions are rounded leading to a loss of reads.</p>

        <h2>ECDF</h2>
        <p>An ECDF plot displays the empirical cumulative distribution.<br>
        The x-axis represents the relative abundace of species/genera (excluding unclassified reads) and the y-axis
        represents the number of species/genera (not the reads!).<br>The plot gives an overview of the distribution
        of relative abundance of the species/genera.</p>

        <h2>TPR FPs Curve</h2>
        <p>The TPR FPs plot displays the change of the true positive rate and the number of false positive
        when shifting the relative abundance threshold.<br>If the relative abundance of a species/genus is below or above
        the set threshold, it is marked as negative or positive respectively (either false or positive, depending on
        the ground truth).<br>Thus, increasing the threshold is a tradeoff between eliminating false positive and
        lowering the true positive rate.</p>

        <h2>Precision - Recall</h2>
        <p>The precision-recall curve shows the tradeoff between precision and recall for different thresholds.<br>
        When increasing the threshold, the precision increases (fewer FPs), but the recall decreases (fewer TPs)</p>

        <h2>L1 Heatmap</h2>
        <p>The L1-distance (Manhattan distance) between two points is the sum of the absolute difference of the
        coordinates.<br>The number of coordinates of a point depends on the number of species/genera in the ground truth
        and in the sample (excluding unclassified).<br>The minimum value is 0 meaning the points are positioned equally.<br>The higher the L1-value,
        the more different the composition of species/genera versus the ground truth.</p>
